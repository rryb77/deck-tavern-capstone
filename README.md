# The Deck Tavern

The Deck Tavern was created to allow gamers in the Hearthstone community to easily create, view, and share card decks with other players. It provides unlimited space for saved decks to remove the constraint of the 15 deck limit in the client itself. Here's a breakdown of what you can do as a user:

### Deck Creators (anyone can create them!)
* Choose a hero class that the deck will be based on
* Create a 30 card deck with game rules built-in to avoid any mistakes
* View saved decks that you created
* Delete any saved decks that you created
* Access the deck code that was generated on the decks to import it right to the game!

### General Users
* View all created decks and sort them by rating, date, and users who created them
* Rate decks that other players have created to help the best rise to the top
* Copy the deck code from any created deck to import and try it out in the game client
* Visit the profile of a deck creator to see all other decks they created


## Running The App

In order to get The Deck Tavern running locally please do the following in your terminal:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
